Version dispription

Version 0.1: mop.py
Updates: Basic structures of the model is created. Including 
            (1) The definition of variables & parameters,
            (2) Solver for future timesteps, 
            (3) Time-integration (Euler-forward)
            (4) Plotting the spatial distribution of variables.
Problem: The boundary condition needs to be fixed.

Version 0.2: Main_10062022_BF.ipynb
Updates:
  (1) The uniform solar forcing case is added as option = 1.
  (2) Completed the initialization part. 
Problem: The systems recevies infinite heating and evaporation.

Version 0.3: Main_10072022_BF.ipynb
Updates:
  (1) The initial evaporation/condensation is self-consistant with other variables. 
  (2) The radiative forcing is switched from solar heating to the total forcing (solar + OLR), which is able to change with time.
  (3) The surface evaporation/condensation term is revised from \dot{\xi}*\delta to E. 
  (4) Created a bug report when p0 is too high.
  (5) Created a simulation progress report.
Problem: When the simulation has a warm start, the values of atmospheric energy, temperature, and pressure goes wrong.
  
Version 0.4: Main_10182022_BF.ipynb
Updates:
  (1) The equations for atmospheric energy budget and EOS are removed. 
      Boundary layer tempeature and pressure are assumed to the same as 
      the surface values. The solver for future timesteps is revised 
      based on that.
Problem: The horizontal latent heat flux need to be included in the 
         prognostic equaton. (when the solar forcing varies spatially).
         
Version 0.4.1: Main_10192022_BF.ipynb (equivalently, Main_10192022_FSA.py)
Updates:
  (1) The boundary condition is switched from no-flux to periodic (in the prognostic equations).
Problem: Testing is required.

Version 0.5: Main_10252022_BF.ipynb
Updates:
  (1) The periodic boundary condition is corrected. Now the model can 
  handle cases with uniform forcing + uniform wind.
  (2) The advection and the non-dimensional number are seperated from 
  the major calculations (for debugging and visudualization).
  (3) The 2nd option for radiation is revised: relaxing from the uniform 
  forcing to a non-uniform forcing gradually.
Problem: The wind goes into instability with non-uniform forcings.

Version 0.5.1: My_Shallow_Water_Model.ipynb
Description: This is the traditional 1D shallow water model. The model only 
            includes 2 variables: h and u. The function of this model is to test 
            the adveciton schemes (from the 10252022 version) under a more 
            straightforward case.
Problem: The system goes into instability with no matter what advection schemes.
