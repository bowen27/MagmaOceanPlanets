Version dispription

Version 0.1: mop.py
Updates: Basic structures of the model is created. Including 
            (1) The definition of variables & parameters,
            (2) Solver for future timesteps, 
            (3) Time-integration (Euler-forward)
            (4) Plotting the spatial distribution of variables.
Problem: The boundary condition needs to be fixed.

Version 0.2: Main_10062022_BF.ipynb
Updates:
  (1) The uniform solar forcing case is added as option = 1.
  (2) Completed the initialization part. 
Problem: The systems recevies infinite heating and evaporation.

Version 0.3: Main_10072022_BF.ipynb
Updates:
  (1) The initial evaporation/condensation is self-consistant with other variables. 
  (2) The radiative forcing is switched from solar heating to the total forcing (solar + OLR), which is able to change with time.
  (3) The surface evaporation/condensation term is revised from \dot{\xi}*\delta to E. 
  (4) Created a bug report when p0 is too high.
  (5) Created a simulation progress report.
Problem: When the simulation has a warm start, the values of atmospheric energy, temperature, and pressure goes wrong.
  

Version 0.4: Main_10182022_BF.ipynb
Updates:
  (1) The equations for atmospheric energy budget and EOS are removed. 
      Boundary layer tempeature and pressure are assumed to the same as 
      the surface values. The solver for future timesteps is revised 
      based on that.
Problem: The horizontal latent heat flux need to be included in the 
         prognostic equaton. (when the solar forcing varies spatially).
         
Version 0.4.1: Main_10192022_BF.ipynb
Updates:
  (1) The boundary condition is switched from no-flux to periodic (in the prognostic equations).
Problem: Testing is required.
